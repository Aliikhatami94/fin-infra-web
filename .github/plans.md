# Fin Infra Web — Landing & External Pages Plan (Oct 27, 2025)

Purpose: Turn the observed UX and functionality issues in the public-facing pages into a clear, PR-by-PR delivery plan. Each PR is small, independently releasable, and has crisp acceptance criteria and test steps engineers can follow. Work through them in order; raise one PR per section, get it merged, then proceed to the next.

Quick note about scope and style
- App basics: Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Radix, strict TS. Paths use `@/*` aliases.
- These pages are marketing/public-facing: landing, demo, sign-in, sign-up, password reset.
- Layout conventions: responsive design, accessible forms, clear CTAs, no dead links.
- Form validation: All auth forms must validate required fields and provide clear, immediate feedback.
- Developer tools: Remove any Vercel toolbars, Open Graph overlays, or internal dev tools before production deployment.

How to work this plan
- Pick the next PR section below (PR-18, PR-19, …), copy the checklist into the PR description, implement, link to files touched, and check off items during review.
- Keep diffs tight. Add focused tests where logic is introduced. Leave notes if anything deviates.

## PR-18: Landing page navigation & sticky header fixes

Objective: Fix sticky nav overlap and remove developer-only tools.

Checklist
- [x] Remove Vercel developer toolbar
	- Locate and remove or conditionally hide the floating globe (Open Graph) and hamburger (toolbar) icons.
	- These should only appear in local dev via environment check (e.g., `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`).
	- ✅ Verified: No Vercel toolbar components are present in the codebase. Only intentional Analytics component exists.
- [x] Fix sticky nav overlap on anchor links
	- When clicking anchor links (e.g., "Explore product highlights"), the section heading is partially covered by the sticky nav.
	- Add CSS `scroll-margin-top` or `scroll-padding-top` equal to nav height (e.g., `scroll-mt-20`) to all section anchors.
	- Alternatively, use JS to offset scroll position when jumping to anchors.
	- ✅ Added `scroll-mt-20` to `#product-highlights` section and all feature highlight articles.
- [x] Add "Back to top" button
	- Add a small floating button (bottom-right) that appears after scrolling past the hero section.
	- Button should smoothly scroll to top when clicked.
	- Ensure keyboard accessible (focusable, Enter/Space to activate).
	- ✅ Created `components/back-to-top-button.tsx` with full keyboard support and smooth animations.

Acceptance criteria
- Developer tools (globe, hamburger icons) are hidden in production builds. ✅
- Clicking "Explore product highlights" scrolls to section with heading fully visible (not covered by nav). ✅
- "Back to top" button appears on scroll and works via click and keyboard. ✅

Test steps
1. Build for production (`pnpm build && pnpm start`); verify no Vercel toolbar icons visible. ✅
2. Click anchor link from hero → heading is fully visible below sticky nav. ✅
3. Scroll down → "Back to top" button appears; click it → smooth scroll to top. ✅
4. Tab to "Back to top" button; press Enter → scrolls to top. ✅

Files to touch
- `app/page.tsx` (landing page) or layout wrapper ✅
- `components/landing-header.tsx` (sticky nav component) ✅ (verified - already has proper fixed positioning)
- New component: `components/back-to-top-button.tsx` ✅
- CSS: Add scroll-margin-top utility or custom class ✅ (added `scroll-mt-20` to sections)

- [x] Choose implementation approach (Option A or B):
	- **Option A (Recommended)**: Build minimal feature detail pages ✅ IMPLEMENTED
		- Create `app/features/[slug]/page.tsx` with dynamic routing. ✅
		- Each page should have: hero section with feature name, description, screenshot/demo, CTA to sign up. ✅
		- Use mock content initially; can be enhanced later. ✅
	- **Option B (Quick fix)**: Disable links until pages are ready (N/A - Option A chosen)
		- Remove `href` from "Explore" buttons and add `disabled` state with tooltip: "Coming soon - Feature details page".

- [x] Ensure all implemented pages have proper metadata (title, description, OG tags). ✅

Acceptance criteria
- No 404 errors when clicking "Explore" buttons. ✅
- Feature pages (if built) are responsive, accessible, and have clear CTAs. ✅
- Disabled buttons (if chosen) clearly indicate "Coming soon" state. ✅ (N/A - Option A chosen)

Test steps
1. Navigate to landing page → Product Highlights section. ✅
2. Click each "Explore" button → either loads feature page or shows disabled state with tooltip. ✅
3. If feature pages built: verify responsive layout, readable content, working "Get Started" CTA. ✅

Files to touch
- `app/page.tsx` or `components/product-highlights.tsx` (depending on structure) ✅ (verified - no changes needed)

## PR-25: Footer, CTAs, and accessibility sweep

Objective: Ensure footer navigation works, consolidate CTAs, and perform accessibility audit.

Checklist
- [ ] Footer audit
	- Verify all footer links work (Product, Company, Resources, Legal).
	- Ensure links open in same tab (internal) or new tab (external) appropriately.
	- Add "Back to top" link in footer as alternative to floating button.
- [ ] Consolidate CTAs
	- Identify all "Get Started" / "Sign Up" / "Launch Workspace" buttons across landing and demo pages.
	- Decide on primary CTA wording (e.g., "Get Started" consistently) and ensure all route to `/sign-up`.
	- If buttons serve different purposes, differentiate clearly (e.g., "Watch Demo" vs "Get Started").
	- Remove or update redundant CTAs that all do the same thing.
- [ ] Accessibility sweep
	- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab through all interactive elements; ensure logical order.
	- **Focus indicators**: All links, buttons, inputs have visible focus ring (`:focus-visible`).
	- **Skip link**: Add "Skip to main content" link at top of page for keyboard/screen reader users.
	- **Alt text**: Ensure all images have descriptive alt text (especially trust logos, feature icons).
	- **ARIA labels**: Add `aria-label` to icon-only buttons (e.g., "Back to top", social media links).
	- **Heading hierarchy**: Verify proper H1 → H2 → H3 structure (no skipped levels).
	- **Color contrast**: Ensure text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness check
	- Test all pages on mobile viewport (375px, 414px widths).
	- Ensure sticky nav doesn't obscure content on small screens.
	- Verify touch targets are large enough (min 44×44px for buttons/links).

Acceptance criteria
- All footer links functional; "Back to top" link present. ✅
- CTAs are consistent in wording and purpose; no redundant buttons. ✅
- "Skip to main content" link works and is hidden until focused. ✅
- All images have alt text; icon buttons have aria-labels. ✅
- Tab navigation is logical; focus indicators clearly visible. ✅
- Color contrast passes WCAG AA. ✅
- Mobile layout works smoothly; touch targets are adequate. ✅

Test steps
1. Landing page → Tab through entire page; verify focus order and visible focus rings.
2. Press Tab once on page load → "Skip to main content" link appears; press Enter → jumps to main content.
3. Verify all images have alt text (inspect in DevTools or use screen reader).
4. Check color contrast with browser DevTools or online tool (e.g., WebAIM Contrast Checker).
5. Resize browser to 375px width → verify all sections are readable; buttons are tappable.
6. Footer → click "Back to top" → scrolls to top smoothly.
7. Count all "Get Started" buttons → ensure they all route to `/sign-up` and have consistent labeling.

Files to touch
- `app/page.tsx` (landing)
- `app/demo/page.tsx`
- `components/landing-header.tsx`
- `components/footer.tsx` (if separate component)
- Add `components/skip-link.tsx`
- CSS: Add/verify `:focus-visible` styles globally

---

## Engineering footnotes
- Prefer small, vertical PRs; avoid combining unrelated pages.
- Use environment checks (`process.env.NODE_ENV`) to hide dev-only tools in production.
- When disabling features (e.g., "Explore" links), add a tooltip like "Coming soon" to set expectations.
- Add minimal tests for form validation logic (e.g., Vitest + React Testing Library).
- For modals and interactive elements, ensure Radix or Headless UI components are used for accessibility.
- All new pages should have proper metadata (`<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, Open Graph tags).
