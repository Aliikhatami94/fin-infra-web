# Vercel Toolbar Configuration

## Overview
The Vercel toolbar is a development tool that appears in the bottom-right corner of deployed preview and production environments. It provides quick access to:
- Open Graph preview
- Comments/feedback
- Deployment information
- Quick links to dashboard

## Disabling the Toolbar in Production

The toolbar should be hidden in production builds to avoid confusing end users. To disable it:

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your project in the Vercel Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **General**
3. Scroll to **Toolbar**
4. Toggle **Enable Toolbar** to OFF for production deployments
5. Keep it enabled for preview deployments if useful for team collaboration

### Method 2: Environment Variable
Add the following environment variable in Vercel:
\`\`\`
VERCEL_TOOLBAR=0
\`\`\`

## Current Implementation
- **Analytics**: The `<Analytics />` component is now wrapped in a production check and only initializes in production builds
- **Development**: During local development (`pnpm dev`), analytics and toolbar are both disabled
- **Production**: Only analytics runs; the Vercel platform toolbar should be disabled via dashboard settings

## Testing
To verify toolbar is hidden:
\`\`\`bash
# Build and run production mode locally
pnpm build && pnpm start

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
# Verify no floating toolbar icons in bottom-right
\`\`\`
